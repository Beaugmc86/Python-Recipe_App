# Recipe App

## Overview

<p>
This is a web application built with Python and the Django framework. It is a full-stack application allowing for CRUD operations with a focus on the backend and building the recipe database with a bit of HTML and CSS-based rendered pages for light styling. Users will be able to login to their own accounts and create and modify their own recipes.
